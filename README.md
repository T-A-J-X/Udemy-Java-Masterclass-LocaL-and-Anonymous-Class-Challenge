# Udemy-Java-Masterclass-LocaL-and-Anonymous-Class-Challenge
In this challenge, Tim assigned us several tasks to demonstrate the use of local classes, anonymous classes, and streams in to create, manipulate, and sort a list of employee records.

        Create a record named Employee that contains First Name, Last Name and Hire Date
        Set up a list of employees with various names and hire dates in the Main method
        Set up a new list of employees that accepts this list as a parameter
        Create a local class to wrap this class (pass Employee to the constructor and include a field for this) and add some calculated fields such as full name and years worked

        1. Create a list of employees using your local class
        2. Create an anonymous class to sort your local class employees by full name or years worked
        3. Print the sorted list
